title: Neuro-Argumentative Learning with Case-Based Reasoning
software: https://github.com/TheAdamG/Gradual-AACBR
openreview: tke5yswemI
abstract: We introduce Gradual Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (Gradual
  AA-CBR), a data-driven, neurosymbolic classification model in which the outcome
  is determined by an argumentation debate structure that is learned simultaneously
  with neural-based feature extractors. Each argument in the debate is an observed
  case from the training data, favouring their labelling. Cases attack or support
  those with opposing or agreeing labellings, with the strength of each argument and
  relationship learned through gradient-based methods. This argumentation debate structure
  provides human-aligned reasoning, improving model interpretability compared to traditional
  neural networks (NNs). Unlike the existing purely symbolic variant, Abstract Argumentation
  for Case-Based Reasoning (AA-CBR), Gradual AA-CBR is capable of multi-class classification,
  automatic learning of feature and data point importance, assigning uncertainty values
  to outcomes, using all available data points, and does not require binary features.
  We show that Gradual AA-CBR performs comparably to NNs whilst significantly outperforming
  existing AA-CBR formulations.
