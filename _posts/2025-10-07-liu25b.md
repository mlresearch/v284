title: Linearithmic Clean-up for Vector-Symbolic Key-Value Memory with Kroneker Rotation
  Products
openreview: MxZZKQfjg5
abstract: 'A computational bottleneck in current Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSAs)
  is the "clean-up" step, which decodes the noisy vectors retrieved from the architecture.  Clean-up
  typically compares noisy vectors against a "codebook" of prototype vectors, incurring
  computational complexity that is quadratic or similar.  We present a new codebook
  representation that supports efficient clean-up, based on Kroneker products of rotation-like
  matrices.  The resulting clean-up time complexity is linearithmic, i.e. $\mathcal{O}(N\text{log}N)$,
  where $N$ is the vector dimension and also the number of vectors in the codebook.  Clean-up
  space complexity  is $\mathcal{O}(N)$.  Furthermore, the codebook is not stored
  explicitly in computer memory: It can be represented in $\mathcal{O}(\text{log}N)$
  space, and individual vectors in the codebook can be materialized in $\mathcal{O}(N)$
  time.  At the same time, asymptotic memory capacity remains comparable to standard
  approaches. Computer experiments confirm these results, demonstrating several orders
  of magnitude more scalability than baseline VSA techniques.'
