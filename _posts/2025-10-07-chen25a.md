title: 'CRAFT: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Visual Functional Affordance Grounding'
openreview: uCAFYKzvju
abstract: We introduce CRAFT, a neuro-symbolic framework for interpretable affordance
  grounding, which identifies the objects in a scene that enable a given action (e.g.,
  “cut”). CRAFT integrates structured commonsense priors from ConceptNet and language
  models with visual evidence from CLIP, using an energy-based reasoning loop to refine
  predictions iteratively. This process yields transparent, goal-driven decisions
  to ground symbolic and perceptual structures. Experiments in multi-object, label-free
  settings demonstrate that CRAFT enhances accuracy while improving interpretability,
  providing a step toward robust and trustworthy scene understanding.
