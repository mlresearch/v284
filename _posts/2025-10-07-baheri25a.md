title: Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer
section: Poster
openreview: tXOU6EULup
abstract: We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that couples
  a classical symbolic planner with a transformer-based policy to address long-horizon
  decision-making under uncertainty. At the high level, the planner assembles an interpretable
  sequence of operators that guarantees logical coherence with task constraints, while
  at the low level each operator is rendered as a sub-goal token that conditions a
  decision transformer to generate fine-grained actions directly from raw observations.
  This bidirectional interface preserves the combinatorial efficiency and explainability
  of symbolic reasoning without sacrificing the adaptability of deep sequence models,
  and it permits a principled analysis that tracks how approximation errors from both
  planning and execution accumulate across the hierarchy. Empirical studies in stochastic
  grid-world domains demonstrate that the proposed method consistently surpasses purely
  symbolic, purely neural, and existing hierarchical baselines in both success and
  efficiency, highlighting its robustness for sequential tasks.
