abstract: 'Formally verifying properties of software code has been a highly desirable
  task, especially with the emergence of LLM-generated code. In the same vein, they
  provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification and mechanistic
  interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific models, despite their
  successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the task of generalized theorem
  proving still remains far from being fully solved and will be a benchmark for reasoning
  capability in LLMs. In this work, we introduce a framework that generates whole
  proofs in a formal language to be used within systems that utilize the power of
  built-in tactics and off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes
  3 components: generating natural language statements of the code to be verified,
  an LLM that generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing
  heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage fine-tuning
  process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model to generate syntactically
  correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that encourages the model to generate
  proofs verified by a theorem prover. We validate our framework using the miniF2F-test
  benchmark and the Isabelle proof assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness
  of the AWS S3 bucket access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the FVEL\textsubscript{\textnormal{ER}}
  dataset for future training tasks.'
