abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
  natural language understanding and generation, but they exhibit problems with logical
  consistency in the output they generate. How can we harness LLMs’ broad-coverage
  parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their inconsistency? We present
  a method for directly integrating an LLM into the interpretation function of the
  formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We provide experimental evidence for
  the feasibility of the method by evaluating the function using datasets created
  from several short-form factuality benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers
  a theoretical framework for neurosymbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM’s knowledge
  while preserving the underlying logic’s soundness and completeness properties.
