section: Poster
openreview: H09CxBms1D
abstract: This paper examines the impact of neurosymbolic learning on sequence analysis
  in Structured Probability Spaces (SPS), comparing its effectiveness against a purely
  neural approach. Sequence analysis in SPS is challenging due to the combinatorial
  explosion of states and the difficulty of obtaining sufficient annotated training
  samples. Additionally, in SPS, the set of realizations with non-zero support is
  often a scattered, non-trivial subset of the Cartesian product of variables, adding
  complexity to learning and inference. The problem of sequence analysis in SPS emerges,
  for example, in reconstructing the activities of goal-directed agents from noisy
  and ambiguous sensor data. We explore the potential of neurosymbolic methods, which
  integrate symbolic background knowledge with neural learning, to constrain the hypothesis
  space and improve learning efficiency. Specifically, we conduct a simulation study
  in human activity recognition using DeepProbLog as a representative for neurosymbolic
  learning. Our results demonstrate that incorporating symbolic knowledge improves
  sample efficiency, generalization, and zero-shot learning, compared to a purely
  neural approach. Furthermore, we show that neurosymbolic models maintain robust
  performance under data scarcity while offering enhanced interpretability and stability.
  These findings suggest that neurosymbolic learning provides a promising foundation
  for sequence analysis in complex, structured domains, where purely neural approaches
  struggle with insufficient training data and limited generalization ability.
