title: Object-Centric Neuro-Argumentative Learning
openreview: dBB58hqTXG
abstract: Over the last decade, as we rely more on deep learning technologies to make
  critical decisions, concerns regarding their safety, reliability and interpretability
  have emerged. We introduce a novel Neural Argumentative Learning (NAL) architecture
  that integrates Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) with deep learning for image
  analysis.  Our architecture consists of neural and symbolic components. The former
  segments and encodes images into facts using object-centric learning, while the
  latter applies ABA learning to develop ABA frameworks enabling predictions with
  images.  Experiments on synthetic data show that the NAL architecture can be competitive
  with a state-of-the-art alternative.
