abstract: Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models have shown remarkable performances
  in the knowledge graph completion task, thanks to their ability to capture and represent
  complex relational patterns. Indeed, modern KGEs encompass different inductive biases,
  which can account for relational patterns like reasoning compositional chains, symmetries,
  anti-symmetries, hierarchical patterns, etc. However, KGE models inherently lack
  interpretability, as their generalization capabilities are purely focused on mapping
  human interpretable units of information, like constants and predicates, into vector
  embeddings in a dense latent space, which is completely opaque to a human operator.  On
  the other hand, different Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods have shown competitive
  results in knowledge completion tasks, but their focus on achieving high accuracy
  often leads to sacrificing interpretability. Many existing NeSy approaches, while
  inherently interpretable, resort to blending their predictions with opaque KGEs
  to boost performance, ultimately diminishing their explanatory power. This paper
  introduces a novel approach to address this limitation by applying a post-hoc NeSy
  method to KGE models. This strategy ensures both high fidelity to KGE models and
  the inherent interpretability of NeSy approaches. The proposed framework defines
  NeSy reasoners that generate explicit logic proofs using predefined or learned rules,
  ensuring transparent and explainable predictions. We evaluate the methodology using
  both accuracy and explainability-based metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness
  of our approach.
