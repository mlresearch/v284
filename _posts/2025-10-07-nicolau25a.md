abstract: 'Computational learning theory states that many classes of boolean formulas
  are learnable in polynomial time. This paper addresses the understudied subject
  of how, in practice, such formulas can be learned by deep neural networks. Specifically,
  we analyze boolean formulas associated with model-sampling benchmarks, combinatorial
  optimization problems, and random 3-CNFs with varying degrees of constrainedness.
  Our experiments indicate that: (i) neural learning generalizes better than pure
  rule-based systems and pure symbolic approach; (ii) relatively small and shallow
  neural networks are very good approximators of formulas associated with combinatorial
  optimization problems; (iii) smaller formulas seem harder to learn, possibly due
  to the fewer positive (satisfying) examples available; and (iv) interestingly, underconstrained
  3-CNF formulas are more challenging to learn than overconstrained ones. Such findings
  pave the way for a better understanding, construction, and use of neurosymbolic
  AI methods.'
