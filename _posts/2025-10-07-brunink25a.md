title: The ART of Link Prediction with KGEs
openreview: xRlIvquvBM
abstract: 'Link Prediction (LP) in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is typically framed as ranking
  candidate entities for a query of the form $(entity, relation,?)$, with models evaluated
  on their ability to rank the correct entities for each query. At the same time,
  Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models used for this task produce unnormalised scores,
  making it unclear how to interpret their belief in the truthfulness of triples across
  different queries. Together, these two factors create a blind spot: models can achieve
  perfect rankings while assigning scores that are not comparable across queries,
  limiting their utility in downstream tasks or even in identifying the most plausible
  triples overall. Indeed, this issue becomes clear when test triples are ranked globally
  and evaluated with IR metrics, revealing that models with unnormalized scores often
  perform poorly due to inconsistent scoring across queries. To address this problem,
  we propose a new KGE model, called ART, which exploits probabilistic Auto-Regressive
  modelling and hence is normalised by design. Despite its conceptual simplicity,
  we show that ART outperforms prior art for discriminative and generative LP as well
  as other post-hoc calibration techniques.'
