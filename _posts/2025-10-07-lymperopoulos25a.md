title: 'Act-to-Ground: A Framework for Symbol Grounding in Planning Domains'
openreview: 2cbCcr4fdD
abstract: 'Neurosymbolic decision-making agents inherit many of the critical transparency
  and interpretability benefits of planning-based symbolic agents but also face one
  of their central challenges: the Symbol Grounding Problem (SGP). Grounding hand-crafted
  symbolic planning domains to percepts typically requires training models with extensive
  annotated data which hinders their applicability to broader problems. In this work
  we propose Act-to-Ground (A2G), a framework for training grounding models for symbolic
  planners with weak supervision obtained through environment interaction or demonstrations.
  We first cast the grounding problem as an inference problem and 1) use satisfiability-based
  planning to provide weak supervision to the grounding model by exploiting knowledge
  already built into the planning domain, 2) propose an MCMC sampler that enables
  sampling weak labels for grounding planners, 3) improve neurosymbolic grounding
  performance via a score-matching objective and 4) propose a learnability condition
  for learning grounding models for planners.'
