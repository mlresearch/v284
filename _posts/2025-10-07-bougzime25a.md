abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (NSAI) represents a transformative
  approach in artificial intelligence (AI) by combining deep learning’s ability to
  handle large-scale and unstructured data with the structured reasoning of symbolic
  methods. By leveraging their complementary strengths, NSAI enhances generalization,
  reasoning, and scalability while addressing key challenges such as transparency
  and data efficiency. This paper systematically studies diverse NSAI architectures,
  highlighting their unique approaches to integrating neural and symbolic components.
  This study then evaluates these architectures against comprehensive set of criteria,
  including generalization, reasoning capabilities, transferability, and interpretability,
  therefore providing a comparative analysis of their respective  strengths and limitations.
  Notably, the Neuro $\rightarrow$ Symbolic $\leftarrow$ Neuro model consistenty outperforms
  its counterparts across all evaluation metrics. This result aligns with state-of-the-art
  research that highlight the efficacy of such architectures in harnessing advanced
  technologies like multi-agent systems. Moreover, our NSAI framework using retrieval-augmented
  illustrates how the 4D printing ontology can be systematically enriched with additional
  classes, object properties, data properties and individuals.
