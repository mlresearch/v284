title: Neuro-Symbolic Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning
openreview: oVb3sJAnfx
abstract: 'Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is an established field
  of policy learning that augments reward-driven exploratory optimisation with example-driven
  constraint inference aimed at exploiting limited observations of expert behaviour.  This
  paper proposes a generalisation of ICRL that employs weighted constraints to better
  support lifelong learning and to handle domains with potentially conflicting social
  norms. We introduce a Neuro-Symbolic ICRL approach (NSICRL) with two key components:  a
  symbolic system based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that infers first-order
  constraints which are human-interpretable and generalise across environment configurations;
  and a neural system based on Deep Q learning (DQL) that efficiently learns near-optimal
  policies subject to those constraints. By weighting the high-level ILP constraints
  (based on the order in which they are learnt) and encoding them as low-level state-action
  penalties in the DQL reward function, we effectively allow earlier constraints to
  be overridden by later ones. Unlike prior work in ICRL, our approach is able to
  continue working when exposed to newly encountered expert behaviours that reveal
  more nuanced exceptions to previously learnt constraints. We evaluate NSICRL in
  a simulated traffic domain, which shows how it outperforms existing methods in terms
  of efficiency and accuracy when learning hard constraints; and which also shows
  the utility of learning defeasible norms in an ICRL context. To the best of our
  knowledge, this is the first approach that places equal emphasis on exploratory
  and imitative learning while also being able to infer defeasible norms in an interpretable
  way that scales to non-trivial examples.'
