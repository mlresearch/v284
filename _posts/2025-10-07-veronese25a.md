title: Learning Symbolic Persistent Macro-Actions for POMDP Solving Over Time
section: Poster
openreview: 8d7Aj30YF4
abstract: This paper proposes an integration of temporal logical reasoning and Partially
  Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to achieve interpretable decision-making
  under uncertainty with macro-actions. Our method leverages a fragment of Linear
  Temporal Logic (LTL) based on Event Calculus (EC) to generate persistent (i.e.,
  constant) macro-actions, which guide Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based POMDP
  solvers over a time horizon, significantly reducing inference time while ensuring
  robust performance. Such macro-actions are learnt via Inductive Logic Programming
  (ILP) from a few traces of execution (belief-action pairs), thus eliminating the
  need for manually designed heuristics and requiring only the specification of the
  POMDP transition model. In the Pocman and Rocksample benchmark scenarios, our learned
  macro-actions demonstrate increased expressiveness and generality when compared
  to time-independent heuristics, indeed offering substantial computational efficiency
  improvements.
