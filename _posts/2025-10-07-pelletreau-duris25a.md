abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on many
  tasks, but this often requires increasingly larger model sizes, which in turn leads
  to more complex internal representations. Explainability techniques (XAI) have made
  remarkable progress in the interpretability of ML models. However, the non-euclidean
  nature of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) makes it difficult to reuse already existing
  XAI methods. While other works have focused on instance-based explanation methods
  for GNNs, very few have investigated model-based methods and, to our knowledge,
  none have tried to probe the embedding of the GNNs for structural graph properties.
  In this paper we present a model agnostic explainability pipeline for Graph Neural
  Networks (GNNs) employing diagnostic classifiers. We propose to consider graph-theoretic
  properties as the features of choice for studying the emergence of representations
  in GNNs. This pipeline aims to probe and interpret the learned representations in
  GNNs across various architectures and datasets, refining our understanding and trust
  in these models.
