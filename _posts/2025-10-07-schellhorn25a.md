title: 'mULLER: A Modular Monad-Based Semantics of the Neurosymbolic ULLER Framework'
software: https://github.com/cherryfunk/mULLER
openreview: zIsnMqATI6
abstract: ULLER (Unified Language for LEarning and Reasoning) provides a single first-order
  logic (FOL) syntax, enabling its knowledge bases to be used directly across a wide
  range of neurosymbolic systems. The original specification endows this syntax with
  three pairwise independent semantics—classical, fuzzy, and probabilistic—each accompanied
  by dedicated semantic rules. We show that these seemingly disparate semantics are
  all instances of one categorical framework based on monads, the very construct that
  models side effects in func- tional programming. This enables the modular addition
  of new semantics and systematic translations between them. As example, we outline
  the addition of generalized quantifi- cation in Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) to arbitrary
  (also infinite) domains by extending the Giry monad to probability spaces. In particular,
  our approach allows a modular imple- mentation of ULLER in Python and Haskell, of
  which we have published initial versions on GitHub.
