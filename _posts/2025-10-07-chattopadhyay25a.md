abstract: Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) systems combine neural network
  and classical symbolic AI mechanisms to exploit the complementary strengths of large-scale,
  generalizable learning and robust, verifiable reasoning. Numerous classifications
  of neurosymbolic AI illustrate how these two components can be integrated in distinctly
  different ways. In this work, we propose reinterpreting instruction-tuned large
  language models as model-grounded symbolic AI systems—where natural language serves
  as the symbolic layer, and grounding is achieved through the model’s internal representation
  space. Within this framework, we investigate and develop novel learning and reasoning
  approaches that preserve structural similarities to traditional learning and reasoning
  paradigms. Comprehensive evaluations across complex mathematical reasoning procedures
  of varying difficulties provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach
  towards learning efficiency and reasoning reliability.
