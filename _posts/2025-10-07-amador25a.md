title: 'SymDQN: Symbolic Knowledge and Reasoning in Neural Network-based Reinforcement
  Learning'
section: Poster
software: https://github.com/IvoAA/SymDQN.git
openreview: ncEGGRYska
abstract: We propose a learning architecture that allows symbolic control and guidance
  in reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. We introduce SymDQN, a novel
  modular approach that augments the existing Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DuelDQN) architecture
  with modules based on the neuro-symbolic framework of Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs).
  The modules guide action policy learning and allow reinforcement learning agents
  to display behavior consistent with reasoning about the environment. Our experiment
  is an ablation study performed on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement
  learning environment of a 5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various
  shapes, each associated with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to
  learn the optimal behavior of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate
  shape recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly
  improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent.
  The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities of
  combining neural and symbolic approaches in reinforcement learning.
