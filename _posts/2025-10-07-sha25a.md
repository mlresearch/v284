abstract: Gestalt principles, established in the 1920s, describe how humans perceive
  individual elements as cohesive wholes. These principles, including proximity, similarity,
  closure, continuity, and symmetry, play a fundamental role in human perception,
  enabling structured visual interpretation. Despite their significance, existing
  AI benchmarks fail to assess models’ ability to infer patterns at the group level,
  where multiple objects following the same Gestalt principle are considered as a
  group using these principles. To address this gap, we introduce Gestalt Vision,
  a diagnostic framework designed to evaluate AI models’ ability to not only identify
  groups within patterns but also reason about the underlying logical rules governing
  these patterns. Gestalt Vision provides structured visual tasks and baseline evaluations
  spanning neural, symbolic, and neural-symbolic approaches, uncovering key limitations
  in current models’ ability to perform human-like visual cognition. Our findings
  emphasize the necessity of incorporating richer perceptual mechanisms into AI reasoning
  frameworks. By bridging the gap between human perception and computational models,
  Gestalt Vision offers a crucial step toward developing AI systems with improved
  perceptual organization and visual reasoning capabilities.
