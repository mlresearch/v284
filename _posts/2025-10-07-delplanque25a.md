title: A Comparative Analysis of Neurosymbolic Methods for Link Prediction
openreview: hCyqbFapJi
abstract: 'Link prediction on knowledge graphs is relevant to various applications,
  such as recommendation systems, question answering, and entity search. This task
  has been approached from different perspectives: symbolic methods leverage rule-based
  reasoning but struggle with scalability and noise, while knowledge graph embeddings
  (KGE) represent entities and relations in a continuous space, enabling scalability
  but often neglecting logical constraints from ontologies. Recently, neurosymbolic
  approaches have emerged to bridge this gap by integrating embedding-based learning
  with symbolic reasoning. This paper provides a structured review of state-of-the-art
  neurosymbolic methods for link prediction. Beyond a qualitative analysis, a key
  contribution of this work is a comprehensive experimental benchmarking, where we
  systematically compare these methods on the same datasets using the same metrics.
  This unified experimental setup allows for a fair assessment of their strengths
  and limitations, bringing elements of answers to following key questions: How accurate
  are these methods? How scalable are they? How beneficial are they for different
  levels of provided knowledge and to which extent are they robust to incorrect knowledge?'
