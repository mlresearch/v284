title: Towards a Neurosymbolic Reasoning System Grounded in Schematic Representations
section: Poster
openreview: bbYk2pD7qY
abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large Language
  Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning, often lacking
  the robust mental representations that enable human-like comprehension. We introduce
  a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that grounds understanding and logical
  reasoning in schematic representations based on image schemas—recurring patterns
  derived from sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. Our system
  operationalizes the spatial foundations of these cognitive structures using declarative
  spatial reasoning within Answer Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction
  problems, we demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through
  embodied cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
  programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical reasoning
  with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation focuses on spatial
  primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for incorporating more complex
  and dynamic representations.
