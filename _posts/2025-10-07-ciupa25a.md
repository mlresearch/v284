title: Exploring Verification Frameworks for Social Choice Alignment
section: Poster
openreview: BfxoGYNJa3
abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents that interact with humans in safety-critical
  situations raises new research problems as we move towards fully autonomous systems
  in domains such as autonomous vehicles or search and rescue. If autonomous agents
  are placed in a dilemma, how would they act? The literature in computational ethics
  has explored the actions and learning methods that emerge in ethical dilemmas. However,
  our position paper examines how ethical dilemmas are not isolated in a social vacuum.
  Our central claim in our position paper is that to enable trust among all human
  users, a neuralsymbolic verification of moral preference alignment is required.
  We propose that the formal robustness properties be applied to social choice modelling.
  We outline how robustness properties can help validate the formation of stable social
  preference clusters in deep neural network classifiers. Our initial results highlight
  the vulnerabilities of models in moral-critical scenarios to perturbations, suggesting
  a verification-training loop for improved robustness. We position this work as an
  inquiry into the viability of verifying moral preference alignment, based on our
  initial results. Ultimately, we aim to contribute to the broader interdisciplinary
  effort that integrates formal methods, social choice theory, and empirical moral
  psychology for interpretable computational ethics.
