title: Ontology-based box embeddings and knowledge graphs for predicting phenotypic
  traits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
software: https://github.com/filipkro/kg-box-emb
openreview: RUiTmnJrSS
abstract: We present a method that uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict and
  interpret digenic deletion fitness in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae from a
  knowledge graph (KG) with ontology-based box embeddings. We construct the KG from
  community databases using terms defined in several ontologies. From the class hierarchies
  in the ontologies, box embeddings are learnt as low dimensional representations
  of the nodes in the graph, which are used together with GNNs to predict cell growth
  for digenic deletions from the KG. With this we show that high level qualitative
  information can be used to predict experimental data. Prediction performance was
  improved when using box embeddings of ontologies to represent the nodes in the graph,
  compared to learning features specific for this task. This suggests that class hierarchies
  in ontologies contain useful information about the domains, which can be extracted
  in the training of the box embeddings. We also demonstrate that our model can generalise
  beyond the task it was trained for by evaluating it on higher order gene deletions.
  Additionally, we apply model interpretability techniques to identify co-occurring
  edges critical for fitness. Our findings are further validated by a biological experiment
  that reveals an association between inositol utilization and osmotic stress resistance,
  emphasising the model’s potential to guide scientific discovery.
