title: Neurosymbolic Association Rule Mining from Tabular Data
software: https://github.com/DiTEC-project/aerial-rule-mining
openreview: baSjVYDlMc
abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of mining patterns among data
  features in the form of logical rules, with applications across a myriad of domains.
  However, high-dimensional datasets often result in an excessive number of rules,
  increasing execution time and negatively impacting downstream task performance.
  Managing this rule explosion remains a central challenge in ARM research. To address
  this, we introduce Aerial+, a novel neurosymbolic ARM method. Aerial+ leverages
  an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural representation of the data, capturing
  associations between features. It extracts rules from this neural representation
  by exploiting the modelâ€™s reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five
  datasets against seven baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art
  results by learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage.
  When integrated into rule-based interpretable machine learning models, Aerial+ significantly
  reduces execution time while maintaining or improving accuracy.
