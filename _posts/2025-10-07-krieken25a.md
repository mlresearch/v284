title: Neurosymbolic Reasoning Shortcuts under the Independence Assumption
software: https://github.com/HEmile/independence-vs-rs/tree/main
openreview: ifoKXDf1KS
abstract: 'The ubiquitous independence assumption among symbolic concepts in neurosymbolic
  (NeSy) predictors is a convenient simplification: NeSy predictors use it to speed
  up probabilistic reasoning. Recent works like van Krieken et al. (2024) and Marconato
  et al. (2024) argued that the independence assumption can hinder learning of NeSy
  predictors and, more crucially, prevent them from correctly modelling uncertainty.
  There is, however, scepticism in the NeSy community around the scenarios in which
  the independence assumption actually limits NeSy systems (Faronius and Dos Martires,
  2025). In this work, we settle this question by formally showing that assuming independence
  among symbolic concepts entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over
  certain concept combinations. Thus, the model fails to be aware of _reasoning shortcuts_,
  i.e., the pathological behaviour of NeSy predictors that predict correct downstream
  tasks but for the wrong reasons.'
