title: Bayesian Inverse Physics for Neuro-Symbolic Robot Learning
section: Poster
openreview: YeT4WtG47d
abstract: Real-world robotic applications, from autonomous exploration to assistive
  technologies, require adaptive, interpretable, and data-efficient learning paradigms.
  While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven significant
  advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in their ability to
  operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic environments. In this position
  paper, we critically assess these limitations and introduce a conceptual framework
  for combining data-driven learning with deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically,
  we propose leveraging differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian
  inference for uncertainty-aware decision-making, and meta-learning for rapid adaptation
  to new tasks. By embedding physical symbolic reasoning within neural models, robots
  could generalize beyond their training data, reason about novel situations, and
  continuously expand their knowledge. We argue that such hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures
  are essential for the next generation of autonomous systems, and to this end, we
  provide a research roadmap to guide and accelerate their development.
