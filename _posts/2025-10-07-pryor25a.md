title: 'Neural-Symbolic Architectural Axioms of Integration: A Manifesto'
section: Poster
openreview: zvDSg565AA
abstract: 'The integration of neural and symbolic methods has long been viewed as
  a promising path toward more general, interpretable, and robust artificial intelligence.
  The past two decades have seen a rapid proliferation of neural-symbolic (NeSy) systems,
  spanning a wide range of architectures, reasoning strategies, and application domains.
  However, this growth has outpaced theoretical clarity: many existing approaches
  conflate the roles of learning, inference, and representation, leading to a fragmented
  field lacking principled foundations. In this work, we address this gap by proposing
  a set of architectural axioms of integrationâ€”formal, implementation-agnostic principles
  that define how neural and symbolic components can be coherently combined. These
  axioms abstract away from system-specific details and instead characterize the structural
  interface between neural perception and symbolic reasoning. Rather than introducing
  a new method, this work offers a foundation to organize, compare, and reason about
  the rapidly expanding space of NeSy approaches.'
