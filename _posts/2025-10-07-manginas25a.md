abstract: Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy AI) has emerged as a promising
  direction for integrating neural learning with symbolic reasoning. Typically, in
  the probabilistic variant of such systems, a neural network first extracts a set
  of symbols from sub-symbolic input, which are then used by a symbolic component
  to reason in a probabilistic manner towards answering a query. In this work, we
  address the problem of formally verifying the robustness of such NeSy probabilistic
  reasoning systems, therefore paving the way for their safe deployment in critical
  domains. We analyze the complexity of solving this problem exactly, and show that
  a decision version of the core computation is $\mathrm{NP}^{\mathrm{PP}}$-complete.
  In the face of this result, we propose the first approach for approximate, relaxation-based
  verification of probabilistic NeSy systems. We demonstrate experimentally on a standard
  NeSy benchmark that the proposed method scales exponentially better than solver-based
  solutions and apply our technique to a real-world autonomous driving domain, where
  we verify a safety property under large input dimensionalities.
