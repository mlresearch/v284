title: Talking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs
openreview: fhyQO1hO4k
abstract: In this work we study various Retrieval Augmented Regeneration (RAG) approaches
  to gain an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in a question-answering
  analysis. To gain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database
  of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped
  from the online news articles. To retrieve information from the text corpus we implement
  a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art large language model
  (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the relevant
  subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based
  framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages
  the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events.  For
  retrieving relevant information from the ontology-based KGs  we implement both direct
  graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches. We compare the performance
  of each method in a question-answering task. We find that while our ontology-based
  KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant subgraphs
  is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries,
  often lack consistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a
  synergistic approach between ontology and LLM-based KG construction, with proposed
  avenues toward that end.
