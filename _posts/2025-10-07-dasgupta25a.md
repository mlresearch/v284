openreview: CePNpwFup1
abstract: 'Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes
  settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent, interpretable
  outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help understand the decisions
  being made, they may inadvertently reveal the underlying proprietary algorithm—an
  undesirable outcome for many practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance
  meaningful transparency with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was
  made and offers actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.
  Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by showing
  how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We propose Model-Agnostic
  Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a novel framework that tackles
  limitations in the existing counterfactual methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic:
  it approximates any black-box model using an explainable rule-based surrogate model.
  Second, this surrogate is used to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable
  outcome for the original underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation
  by excluding the “effort” associated with feature changes that occur automatically
  due to causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides
  a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a favourable
  outcome.  We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and actionable counterfactual
  recommendations compared to existing techniques all while having a lower cost. Our
  findings highlight MC3G’s potential to enhance transparency, accountability, and
  practical utility in decision-making processes that incorporate machine-learning
  approaches.'
