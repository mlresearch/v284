title: 'Toward a Clearer Characterization of Neuro-Symbolic Frameworks: A Brief Comparative
  Analysis'
openreview: psXDX4Q8E5
abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
  with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning capacities,
  explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with the flexibility
  and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex problems with more reliability
  while being data-efficient. However, this recently growing topic poses a challenge
  to developers with its learning curve, lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and
  unifying frameworks. In this paper, we characterize the technical facets of existing
  NeSy frameworks, such as the symbolic representation language, integration with
  neural models, and the underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses
  on algorithms instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
  to leverage  problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic modeling,
  we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - $\textit{DeepProbLog}$, $\textit{Scallop}$,
  and $\textit{DomiKnowS}$. We identify the challenges within each facet that lay
  the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each framework in solving a variety
  of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim to spark transformative action
  and encourage the community to rethink this problem in novel ways.
