title: 'JARVIS: A Neuro-Symbolic Commonsense Reasoning Framework for Conversational
  Embodied Agents'
openreview: T9J96eD2Li
abstract: Building a conversational embodied agent to execute real-life tasks has
  been a long-standing yet quite challenging research goal, as it requires effective
  human-agent communication, multi-modal understanding, long-range sequential decision
  making, etc. Traditional symbolic methods have scaling and generalization issues,
  while end-to-end deep learning models suffer from data scarcity and high task complexity,
  and are often hard to explain. To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a
  neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable
  conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting
  large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and
  by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module
  reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level
  common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and
  efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results
  on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History
  (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g.,
  our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1% to 15.8%). Moreover,
  we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance
  and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings.
