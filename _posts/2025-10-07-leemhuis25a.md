title: Understanding the Expressive Capabilities of Knowledge Base Embeddings under
  Box Semantics
openreview: 0d4sp8MjWs
abstract: 'Knowledge base embeddings are a widely applied technique, used for instance
  to improve link prediction tasks on knowledge graphs by using the geometric regularities
  occurring during learning. Techniques where ontological concepts are interpreted
  as boxes have shown to be particularly useful in this context, as they are both
  suitably expressive and of low computational complexity. However, to use those regularities
  for learning, it is necessary to determine and understand the possible biases in
  the approach: how do we distinguish what is learned due to regularities in the data
  from what is simply based on the representational limitations of the embedding?
  In this paper, we establish that there are some severe limitations in expressivity
  when modeling description logic ontologies with box embeddings in intended target
  languages such as $\mathcal{ELHO}(\circ)^\bot$. We illustrate that, under some weak
  assumptions, box semantics always satisfy Hellyâ€™s Property, and is thus too weak
  to capture semantically $\mathcal{ELHO}(\circ)^\bot$ in an adequate way.  We then
  characterize how so-called Helly-satisfiable $\mathcal{ELHO}(\circ)^\bot$ ontologies
  can be adequately determined. We discuss the implications of this result with respect
  to existing box embedding approaches and real-world use cases.'
