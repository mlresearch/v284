title: 'KEA Explain: Explanations of Hallucinations using Graph Kernel Analysis'
software: https://github.com/Reih02/hallucination_explanation_graph_kernel_analysis
openreview: sQlQ0mHZ3G
abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations: statements
  that are syntactically plausible but lack factual grounding. This research presents
  KEA (Kernel-Enriched AI) Explain: a neurosymbolic framework that detects and explains
  such hallucinations by comparing knowledge graphs constructed from LLM outputs with
  ground truth data from Wikidata or contextual documents. Using graph kernels and
  semantic clustering, the method provides explanations for detected hallucinations,
  ensuring both robustness and interpretability. Our framework achieves competitive
  accuracy in detecting hallucinations across both open- and closed-domain tasks,
  and is able to generate contrastive explanations, enhancing transparency. This research
  advances the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains and provides a foundation
  for future work on precision improvements and multi-source knowledge integration.'
