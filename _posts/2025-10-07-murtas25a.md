title: An evidence-based neuro-symbolic framework for ambiguous image scene classification
openreview: 6UnuZcQ2zY
abstract: In this study, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic approach to deal with the
  inherent ambiguity in image scene classification, combining the usage of pre-trained
  deep learning (DL) models with concepts from modal logic and evidence theory. The
  DL models are used to detect objects and estimate their depth in a set of labeled
  images. The obtained outputs are employed to form a dataset of instances characterizing
  the possible classes. Subsequently, a multi-valued mapping is defined between the
  data instances and the considered images resulting into each image being represented
  by the set of instances associated with it. The obtained mapping is utilized to
  infer necessity and possibility conditions of each class, or equivalently its upper
  (plausibility) and lower (belief) probabilities. Based on these interval evaluations,
  a rule-based and a score-based classifiers are built. The overall method is explainable
  and directly interpretable, robust to data scarcity and data imbalance. The presented
  framework is studied and evaluated on an abandoned bag detection use case.
