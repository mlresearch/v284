abstract: 'Visual Question Answering (VQA) is the task of answering natural language
  questions about images, which is a challenge for AI systems. To enhance adaptability
  and reduce training overhead, we address VQA in a zero-shot setting by leveraging
  pre-trained neural modules without additional fine-tuning. Our proposed hybrid neurosymbolic
  framework, whose capabilities are demonstrated on the challenging GQA dataset, integrates
  neural and symbolic components through logic-based reasoning via Answer-Set Programming.
  Specifically, our pipeline employs large language models for semantic parsing of
  input questions, followed by the generation of a scene graph that captures relevant
  visual content. Interpretable rules then operate on the symbolic representations
  of both the question and the scene graph to derive an answer. Our framework provides
  a key advantage: it enables full transparency into the reasoning process. Using
  an existing explanation tool, we illustrate how our method fosters trust by making
  decisions interpretable and facilitates error analysis when predictions are incorrect.
  Beyond explaining its own reasoning, our framework can also explain answers from
  more opaque models by integrating their answers into our system, enabling broader
  interpretability in VQA.'
