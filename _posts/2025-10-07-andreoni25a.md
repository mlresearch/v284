title: 'T-ILR: a Neurosymbolic Integration for LTLf'
section: Poster
openreview: TI0aaA9Nfa
abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
  learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains. However,
  methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored. The only existing
  approach relies on an explicit representation of a finite-state automaton corresponding
  to the temporal specification. Instead, we aim at directly injecting the temporal
  knowledge into the neural model without having to rely on a separate symbolic structure.
  Specifically, we propose a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
  logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf),
  directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We extend the
  Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging the recent
  introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed method Temporal
  Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an existing benchmark for
  temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the classification of image
  sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The results demonstrate improved
  accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art method.
