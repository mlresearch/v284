title: A Comparative Study of Neurosymbolic AI Approaches to Interpretable Logical
  Reasoning
section: Poster
openreview: uO0oaNY9fC
abstract: 'General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively
  on domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
  (LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable.
  As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts
  to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic
  approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising
  models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii)
  the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the
  neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising
  results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance
  on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
  has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following
  question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning?
  To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are
  introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and
  LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models
  as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates
  that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning
  because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities
  and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach,
  we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
  model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.'
