title: 'ArgRAG: Explainable Retrieval Augmented Generation using Quantitative Bipolar
  Argumentation'
openreview: oYFXK9szLN
abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating
  external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in high-stakes domains—namely,
  sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence and opaque, stochastic decision-making.
  We propose \textsc{ArgRAG}, an explainable, and contestable alternative that replaces
  black-box reasoning with structured inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation
  Framework (QBAF). \textsc{ArgRAG} constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and
  performs deterministic reasoning under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully
  explanaining and contesting decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks,
  PubHealth and RAGuard, \textsc{ArgRAG} achieves strong accuracy while significantly
  improving transparency.
