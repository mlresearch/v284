title: High Quality Embeddings for Horn Logic Reasoning
section: Poster
openreview: QeZuGranYJ
abstract: 'Neural networks can be trained to rank the choices made by logical reasoners,
  resulting in more efficient searches for answers. A key step in this process is
  creating useful embeddings, i.e., numeric representations of logical statements.
  This paper introduces and evaluates several approaches to creating embeddings that
  result in better downstream results. We train embeddings using triplet loss, which
  requires examples consisting of an anchor, a positive example, and a negative example.
  We introduce three ideas: generating anchors that are more likely to have repeated
  terms, generating positive and negative examples in a way that ensures a good balance
  between easy, medium, and hard examples, and periodically emphasizing the hardest
  examples during training. We conduct several experiments to evaluate this approach,
  including a comparison of different embeddings across different knowledge bases,
  in an attempt to identify what characteristics make an embedding well-suited to
  a particular reasoning task.'
