title: 'Concept Probing: Where to Find Human-Defined Concepts'
openreview: LSe4snLk8X
abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek
  into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing, additional
  classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
  concepts of interest. However, the performance of these probes is highly dependent
  on the internal representations they probe from, making identifying the appropriate
  layer to probe an essential task. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically
  identify which layerâ€™s representations in a neural network model should be considered
  when probing for a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative
  and regular the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our
  findings through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network
  models and datasets.
