title: Neurosymbolic models based on hybrids of convolutional neural networks and
  decision trees
section: Poster
openreview: NdbjM5ZCor
abstract: Building on previous work, we propose a specific form of neurosymbolic model
  consisting of the composition of convolutional neural network layers with a sparse
  oblique classification tree (having hyperplane splits using few features). This
  can be seen as a neural feature extraction that finds a more suitable representation
  of the input space followed by a form of rule-based reasoning to arrive at a decision
  that can be explained. We show how to control the sparsity across the different
  decision nodes of the tree and its effect on the explanations produced. We demonstrate
  this on image classification tasks and show, among other things, that relatively
  small subsets of neurons are entirely responsible for the classification into specific
  classes, and that the neurons’ receptive fields focus on areas of the image that
  provide best discrimination.
