title: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Counterfactual Fairness
software: https://github.com/xheilmann/CounterfactualFair_LTN
openreview: YZSDHz3Ydb
abstract: Integrating fairness into machine learning models has been an important
  consideration for the last decade. Here, neurosymbolic models offer a valuable opportunity,
  as they allow the specification of symbolic, logical constraints that are often
  guaranteed to be satisfied. However, research on neurosymbolic applications to algorithmic
  fairness is still in an early stage. With our work, we bridge this gap by integrating
  counterfactual fairness into the neurosymbolic framework of Logic Tensor Networks
  (LTN). We use LTN to express accuracy and counterfactual fairness constraints in
  first-order logic and employ them to achieve desirable levels of both performance
  and fairness at training time. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying causal
  model and data generation technique; as such, it may be easily integrated into existing
  pipelines that generate and extract counterfactual examples. We show, through concrete
  examples on three real-world datasets, that logical reasoning about counterfactual
  fairness has some important advantages, among which its intrinsic interpretability,
  and its flexibility in handling subgroup fairness. Compared to three recent methodologies
  in counterfactual fairness, our experiments show that a neurosymbolic, LTN-based
  approach attains better levels of counterfactual fairness.
