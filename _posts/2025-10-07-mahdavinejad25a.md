abstract: 'Depression remains a pervasive mental health disorder that demands prompt
  diagnosis and intervention. Although social media data presents a promising avenue
  for early detection, traditional deep neural models are frequently critiqued for
  their lack of interpretability and susceptibility to bias. We introduce ProtoDep—a
  neurosymbolic framework that integrates clinically grounded categorizations (e.g.,
  PHQ-9 symptoms) with large language model–assisted prototype learning. Unlike conventional
  black-box models, ProtoDep aligns individual tweets with symptom-level prototypes,
  offering interpretable explanations at three levels: (i) symptom-level insights
  that map user posts to recognized depressive patterns, (ii) case-based reasoning
  that compares users to representative prototype profiles, and (iii) transparent
  concept-level decisions, wherein classification at inference time is driven by the
  distances between the user profile and prototype user and symptom clusters, yielding
  clear, quantifiable explanations. By integrating symbolic mental health constructs
  with neural embeddings, ProtoDep achieves a mean F1-score of 94% across five benchmark
  datasets and establishes a foundation for interpretable depression screening pipelines
  with potential applicability in clinical settings.'
